# US-Bikeshare-Data-Exploration
The objective of this project is to analyze bike share data for three major cities in the United States - Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The analysis will be performed using Python programming language to import and explore the data, calculate descriptive statistics and answer interesting questions related to the data. Additionally, an interactive terminal script will be developed to present the results of the analysis based on user inputs.
## The Datasets
The datasets provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider in the US, contains randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities. The data files for all three cities contain the same core six columns:

  Start Time
  End Time
  Trip Duration
  Start Station
  End Station
  User Type
  
The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

  Gender
  Birth Year
